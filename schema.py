"""agent/schema.py

BeliefState only. The action vocabulary lives in the engine contract and the
decision rows are written by agent.py's _log, so a second copy here would only
drift out of step.

Ruleset v1.3 has two clue shapes, and that is what this file is built around.

  definite  rules out exactly one id in one category, on its own
  indirect  is a midnight fact (who was in which room, where a weapon was,
            who was with whom). On its own it rules out nothing. It only bites
            when combined with other facts.

So belief is no longer "apply one clue, drop one candidate". It is a closure
over everything I hold, recomputed from scratch. The closure here is a port of
the engine's competitive_rules.infer(), deliberately kept rule-for-rule
identical: a belief that eliminates more than the engine can prove is a
hallucination, and a belief that eliminates less wastes clues.

evidence[cat][id] keeps the support set -- which clue IDs together killed that
candidate. H2 compares the evidence the model cites against what actually moved
the belief, so that trail has to exist, and with indirect clues the trail is a
set rather than a single ID.

narrated and possession packets carry no checkable fact (the engine strips the
original), so they are counted but never asserted.
